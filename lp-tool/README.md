# Welcome to Ron's LP Tool
A simple calculator to show the value of your Alephium LP Tokens

## How It Works:
It all starts from the user's input into the site, which is an amount of LP Tokens. You might find this number in your Alephium Wallet, on a portfolio viewer like alph.pro, or directly on [Ayin Decentralized Exhange](ayin.app) in the [Pounder](ayin.app/vault) or in [LP Staking](ayin.app/stake).

### Calculation:
First, lets define variables to make this easier. 
**I = Input** - The amount of LP Tokens the user types into the tool
**T<sup>0</sup>
