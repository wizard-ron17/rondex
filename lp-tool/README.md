# Welcome to Ron's LP Tool
A simple calculator to show the value of your Alephium LP Tokens

## How It Works:
It all starts from the user's input into the site, which is an amount of LP Tokens. You might find this number in your Alephium Wallet, on a portfolio viewer like alph.pro, or directly on the dex ayin.app in the Pounder or in LP Staking.
